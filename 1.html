        <h3>Description :-</h3>
        <p>The video opens with <b>a quick aerial shot</b> of a <b>stunning waterfall</b> nestled in a <i>lush green valley</i>. The camera zooms in, capturing <u>the water cascading down</u> the rocks in a brilliant rush. The sound of the roaring water fills the air as mist rises, <i>catching the sunlight</i> and creating <i>a shimmering effect</i>.</p>
        <p>In just a few seconds, we see a close-up of <b>the water splashing into a crystal-clear pool</b> below, sending droplets flying in every direction. The scene fades out with a beautiful rainbow forming in the mist, leaving viewers with a sense of awe and tranquility.</p>
